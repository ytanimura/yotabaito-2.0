### Algebraic approach for Duflo's polynomial conjecture

The Laplacian is invariant to isometric transforms. his property holds not only in the Euclidian space, but also in general Riemannian manifolds.
Our interest is the generalization of this property: how many differential operators are invariant to isometric transforms?

In my doctoral thesis, we consider Duflo's polynomial conjecture, algebraic abstraction of the above question, by pure-alogebraic approach.

### Deformation problem of Clifford-Klein forms with nilpotent translation groups

Two figures in the Euclidean plane are congruent if one of them is shifted to the other by the three kinds of transforms: the translations, the rotations, and the reflections.
In other words, the geometry of the Euclidean space is defined by the symmetry caused by a collection of all such transforms.
In this way, a space whose geometry is defined by the symmetry caused by a collection of transformations is called a homogeneous space.

Next, we consider the traditional RPG map, one advances to the edge of the map and comes out the other side.
Such an "earth" is not spherical, but has the shape of a doughnut surface (i.e. toric).
However, its local structure is flat, like a plane, unlike a doughnut.
Such a space whose geometry is shared with a homogeneous space is called a Clifford-Klein form.

The subject of master's thesis was to classify Clifford-Klein forms that share the same local structure with an homogeneous space
whose collection of symmetry transformations satisfies the special condition "nilpotent".

## Education and outreach activities

### [群馬県高校生数学キャンプ](http://www.ms.u-tokyo.ac.jp/tambara/mathcamp-for-highschool/index.html)

学部4年から博士2年までの間、群馬県高校生数学キャンプにTAとして毎年行っていた。群馬県高校生数学キャンプは、毎年秋頃に2泊3日の合宿形式で行われる。高校生は4人で班を構成し、2日目午前までに行われる講義の中から見つけた課題を研究して3日目午前に発表する。TAは各班に1人ずつつき、研究の補助や発表の指導などを行う。

### [UTokyo Future Faculty Program](https://www.utokyofd.com/ffp/)

I took the Future Faculty Program at the University of Tokyo during my first year as a Ph. I was the first participant in the Graduate School of Mathematical Sciences.  
I was able to learn everything from how to write a syllabus to how to organize a lecture and typical active learning techniques.

### [Videos for mathematical education](./?doc=lecture-movie) (Japanese)

I made a video of a lecture I gave on topological space theory in a graduate school lecture. Through a friend of mine, I held a viewing party at Azabu High School.

### [さとりのしょ (Words of Wisdom)](./?doc=satorinosho) (Japanese)

It was a series of notebooks I was making during my graduate school years. There are no plans to translate them into English.
