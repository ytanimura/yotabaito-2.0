# YOTABAITO 2.0

**This is the source code to build the portfolio site.**  

**ðŸ‘‰[The built portfolio site is here](https://www.yotabaito.net)ðŸ‘ˆ**

YOTABAITO is [ytanimura](https://github.com/ytanimura)'s portfolio site.

## Technical overview

- Clean architecture with Rust + Yew + Trunk.
- All background effects are rendered in real time by WebGL.

## Build

To build this page, the following tools must be prepared in advance.

- `cargo`: Build system for Rust.
- `trunk`: Build system for web pages based on rust-wasm.
- `wasm-bindgen-cli`: wasm-bindgen command line tool.

For more details, please see [Dockerfile for CI container](./docker/ci-container.dockerfile).

## Files and directories

Since a folder contain only markdowns, we will not put README.md in each folder, but will explain the entire contents here.

### `docker`

Dockerfile for CI container.

### `Cargo.*` + `src` + `build.rs`

Rust source code for building wasm.

### `texts`

All descriptive part. It is described by markdown, and translated into HTML by `build.rs` and embedded in wasm.

### `shaders`

Shaders for Background effects. All background effects are rendered in real time by WebGL.
All are written in code for Shadertoy and can be debugged in VSCode's Shader Toy extension.

### `styles`

SCSS style sheets.

### `resources`

Resource files. If the files already exist on the Internet, they are downloaded to this folder
by a trunk pre-script instead of being placed in the repository.

### `index.html + Trunk.toml`

These are required to build with `trunk`.

## Shader debug status

| OS | Browser | Status |

| WSL | Firefox | Very slow because using CPU |  
| MacOS | Chrome, Safari | OK, perhaps a little slow |
